In this repository I analys the various data of the classic Pokemon game

The purpose of this analysis is to answer to this 6 different questions and try to explain that results  
The six questions are:  
1 - Which type is the strongest overall? Which is the weakest?
2 - Which double-type exisitng is the strongest? Which is the weakest?
3 - Which type is the most likely to be a legendary Pokemon?
4 - How does height and weight of a Pokemon correlate with its various base stats?
5 - Can you build a Pokemon dream team? 
    A team of 6 Pokemon that inflicts the most damage while remaining relatively impervious to any other team of 6 Pokemon.
