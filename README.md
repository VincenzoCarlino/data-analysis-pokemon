# Data Analysis Pokemon
In this repository I analys the various data of the classic Pokemon game

The purpose of this analysis is to answer to this 6 different questions and try to explain that results.  

The six questions are:  
1. Which type is the strongest overall? Which is the weakest? 

2. Which double-type exisitng is the strongest? Which is the weakest?  

3. Which type is the most likely to be a legendary Pokemon?  

4. How does height and weight of a Pokemon correlate with its various base stats?  

5. Can you build a Pokemon dream team?  

  > A team of 6 Pokemon that inflicts the most damage while remaining relatively impervious to any other team of 6 Pokemon.

All the sets used in this analysis are in the directory called [sets](https://github.com/massimilianobaldo/data-analysis-pokemon/tree/master/sets).

The real analysis is written in RMarkdown in the file called [prosa.Rmd](https://github.com/massimilianobaldo/data-analysis-pokemon/tree/master/prosa.Rmd), so you can follow the code using RStudio.

Otherwise, you can download the html document [prosa.html](https://github.com/massimilianobaldo/data-analysis-pokemon/tree/master/prosa.html) which is the pre-formatted analysis in a readabble way.

By the way, all the files are written in italian for the presentation but I have already prepared the file in english.
